Image-Classification:  
The objective of this Project is to get you familiarize with the problems of “classification” and “verification” with a popular problem space of “face”.  
Expectation at the end:  
(i) Familiarity with this (a specific) problem space and the associated nuances.  
(ii) some exposure to the visualization of data  
(iii) conduct experiments and report results.  
(iv) use of graphs/tables to present results.  
(v) decide parameters yourself (“best” according to you) and defend your choices.  

Features/Representations Used:  
(a)PCA/Eigen face  
(b) KernelPCA  
(c) LDA/Fisher face  
(d) Kernel Fisher Face  
(e) VGGFace  
(f) ResNet features
